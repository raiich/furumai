To invoke a rule, we must always have a current context.\r\n *\r\n *  The parent contexts are useful for computing lookahead sets and\r\n *  getting error information.\r\n *\r\n *  These objects are used during parsing and prediction.\r\n *  For the special case of parsers, we use the subclass\r\n *  ParserRuleContext.\r\n *\r\n *  @see ParserRuleContext\r\n */\r\nclass RuleContext extends RuleNode_1.RuleNode {\r\n    constructor(parent, invokingState) {\r\n        super();\r\n        this._parent = parent;\r\n        this.invokingState = invokingState != null ? invokingState : -1;\r\n    }\r\n    static getChildContext(parent, invokingState) {\r\n        return new RuleContext(parent, invokingState);\r\n    }\r\n    depth() {\r\n        let n = 0;\r\n        let p = this;\r\n        while (p) {\r\n            p = p._parent;\r\n            n++;\r\n        }\r\n        return n;\r\n    }\r\n    /** A context is empty if there is no invoking state; meaning nobody called\r\n     *  current context.\r\n     */\r\n    get isEmpty() {\r\n        return this.invokingState === -1;\r\n    }\r\n    // satisfy the ParseTree / SyntaxTree interface\r\n    get sourceInterval() {\r\n        return Interval_1.Interval.INVALID;\r\n    }\r\n    get ruleContext() { return this; }\r\n    get parent() { return this._parent; }\r\n    /** @since 4.7. {@see ParseTree#setParent} comment */\r\n    setParent(parent) {\r\n        this._parent = parent;\r\n    }\r\n    get payload() { return this; }\r\n    /** Return the combined text of all child nodes.

Note that the operations\r\n * are done lazily--only if you convert the buffer to a {@link String} with\r\n * {@link TokenStream#getText()}. This is very efficient because you are not\r\n * moving data around all the time. As the buffer of tokens is converted to\r\n * strings, the {@link #getText()} method(s) scan the input token stream and\r\n * check to see if there is an operation at the current index. If so, the\r\n * operation is done and then normal {@link String} rendering continues on the\r\n * buffer. This is like having multiple Turing machine instruction streams\r\n * (programs) operating on a single input tape. :)\r\n *\r\n * This rewriter makes no modifications to the token stream. It does not ask the\r\n * stream to fill itself up nor does it advance the input cursor. The token\r\n * stream `TokenStream.index` will return the same value before and\r\n * after any {@link #getText()} call.\r\n *\r\n * The rewriter only works on tokens that you have in the buffer and ignores the\r\n * current input cursor. If you are buffering tokens on-demand, calling\r\n * {@link #getText()} halfway through the input will only do rewrites for those\r\n * tokens in the first half of the file.\r\n *\r\n * Since the operations are done lazily at {@link #getText}-time, operations do\r\n * not screw up the token index values. That is, an insert operation at token\r\n * index `i` does not change the index values for tokens\r\n * `i`+1..n-1.\r\n *\r\n * Because operations never actually alter the buffer, you may always get the\r\n * original token stream back without undoing anything. Since the instructions\r\n * are queued up, you can easily simulate transactions and roll back any changes\r\n * if there is an error just by removing instructions.

Then the {@link #match} routines can compare an actual\r\n * {@link ParseTree} from a parse with this pattern. Tag `<ID>` matches\r\n * any `ID` token and tag `<expr>` references the result of the\r\n * `expr` rule (generally an instance of `ExprContext`.\r\n *\r\n * Pattern `x = 0;` is a similar pattern that matches the same pattern\r\n * except that it requires the identifier to be `x` and the expression to\r\n * be `0`.\r\n *\r\n * The {@link #matches} routines return `true` or `false` based\r\n * upon a match for the tree rooted at the parameter sent in. The\r\n * {@link #match} routines return a {@link ParseTreeMatch} object that\r\n * contains the parse tree, the parse tree pattern, and a map from tag name to\r\n * matched nodes (more below). A subtree that fails to match, returns with\r\n * {@link ParseTreeMatch#mismatchedNode} set to the first tree node that did not\r\n * match.\r\n *\r\n * For efficiency, you can compile a tree pattern in string form to a\r\n * {@link ParseTreePattern} object.\r\n *\r\n * See `TestParseTreeMatcher` for lots of examples.\r\n * {@link ParseTreePattern} has two static helper methods:\r\n * {@link ParseTreePattern#findAll} and {@link ParseTreePattern#match} that\r\n * are easy to use but not super efficient because they create new\r\n * {@link ParseTreePatternMatcher} objects each time and have to compile the\r\n * pattern in string form before using it.\r\n *\r\n * The lexer and parser that you pass into the {@link ParseTreePatternMatcher}\r\n * constructor are used to parse the pattern in string form. The lexer converts\r\n * the `<ID> = <expr>;` into a sequence of four tokens (assuming lexer\r\n * throws out whitespace or puts it on a hidden channel). Be aware that the\r\n * input stream is reset for the lexer (but not the parser; a\r\n * {@link ParserInterpreter} is created to parse the input.). Any user-defined\r\n * fields you have put into the lexer might get changed when this mechanism asks\r\n * it to scan the pattern string.\r\n *\r\n * Normally a parser does not accept token `<expr>` as a valid\r\n * `expr` but, from the parser passed in, we create a special version of\r\n * the underlying grammar representation (an {@link ATN}) that allows imaginary\r\n * tokens representing rules (`<expr>`) to match entire rules. We call\r\n * these *bypass alternatives*.\r\n *\r\n * Delimiters are `<`} and `>`}, with `\\` as the escape string\r\n * by default, but you can set them to whatever you want using\r\n * {@link #setDelimiters}.

Subsequent prediction\r\n * requests go through the DFA first. If they reach a state without an edge for\r\n * the current symbol, the algorithm fails over to the ATN simulation to\r\n * complete the DFA path for the current input (until it finds a conflict state\r\n * or uniquely predicting state).\r\n *\r\n * All of that is done without using the outer context because we want to create\r\n * a DFA that is not dependent upon the rule invocation stack when we do a\r\n * prediction. One DFA works in all contexts. We avoid using context not\r\n * necessarily because it's slower, although it can be, but because of the DFA\r\n * caching problem. The closure routine only considers the rule invocation stack\r\n * created during prediction beginning in the decision rule. For example, if\r\n * prediction occurs without invoking another rule's ATN, there are no context\r\n * stacks in the configurations. When lack of context leads to a conflict, we\r\n * don't know if it's an ambiguity or a weakness in the strong LL(*) parsing\r\n * strategy (versus full LL(*)).\r\n *\r\n * When SLL yields a configuration set with conflict, we rewind the input and\r\n * retry the ATN simulation, this time using full outer context without adding\r\n * to the DFA. Configuration context stacks will be the full invocation stacks\r\n * from the start rule. If we get a conflict using full context, then we can\r\n * definitively say we have a true ambiguity for that input sequence. If we\r\n * don't get a conflict, it implies that the decision is sensitive to the outer\r\n * context. (It is not context-sensitive in the sense of context-sensitive\r\n * grammars.)\r\n *\r\n * The next time we reach this DFA state with an SLL conflict, through DFA\r\n * simulation, we will again retry the ATN simulation using full context mode.\r\n * This is slow because we can't save the results and have to \"interpret\" the\r\n * ATN each time we get that input.\r\n *\r\n * **CACHING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTIONS**\r\n *\r\n * We could cache results from full context to predicted alternative easily and\r\n * that saves a lot of time but doesn't work in presence of predicates. The set\r\n * of visible predicates from the ATN start state changes depending on the\r\n * context, because closure can fall off the end of a rule. I tried to cache\r\n * tuples (stack context, semantic context, predicted alt) but it was slower\r\n * than interpreting and much more complicated. Also required a huge amount of\r\n * memory. The goal is not to create the world's fastest parser anyway. I'd like\r\n * to keep this algorithm simple. By launching multiple threads, we can improve\r\n * the speed of parsing across a large number of files.\r\n *\r\n * There is no strict ordering between the amount of input used by SLL vs LL,\r\n * which makes it really hard to build a cache for full context. Let's say that\r\n * we have input A B C that leads to an SLL conflict with full context X. That\r\n * implies that using X we might only use A B but we could also use A B C D to\r\n * resolve conflict. Input A B C D could predict alternative 1 in one position\r\n * in the input and A B C E could predict alternative 2 in another position in\r\n * input. The conflicting SLL configurations could still be non-unique in the\r\n * full context prediction, which would lead us to requiring more input than the\r\n * original A B C.\tTo make a\tprediction cache work, we have to track\tthe exact\r\n * input\tused during the previous prediction. That amounts to a cache that maps\r\n * X to a specific DFA for that context.\r\n *\r\n * Something should be done for left-recursive expression predictions. They are\r\n * likely LL(1) + pred eval. Easier to do the whole SLL unless error and retry\r\n * with full LL thing Sam does.\r\n *\r\n * **AVOIDING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTION**\r\n *\r\n * We avoid doing full context retry when the outer context is empty, we did not\r\n * dip into the outer context by falling off the end of the decision state rule,\r\n * or when we force SLL mode.\r\n *\r\n * As an example of the not dip into outer context case, consider as super\r\n * constructor calls versus function calls. One grammar might look like\r\n * this:\r\n *\r\n * ```antlr\r\n * ctorBody\r\n *   : '{' superCall? stat* '}'\r\n *   ;\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Or, you might see something like\r\n *\r\n * ```antlr\r\n * stat\r\n *   : superCall ';'\r\n *   | expression ';'\r\n *   | ...\r\n *   ;\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * In both cases I believe that no closure operations will dip into the outer\r\n * context. In the first case ctorBody in the worst case will stop at the '}'.\r\n * In the 2nd case it should stop at the ';'. Both cases should stay within the\r\n * entry rule and not dip into the outer context.\r\n *\r\n * **PREDICATES**\r\n *\r\n * Predicates are always evaluated if present in either SLL or LL both. SLL and\r\n * LL simulation deals with predicates differently. SLL collects predicates as\r\n * it performs closure operations like ANTLR v3 did. It delays predicate\r\n * evaluation until it reaches and accept state. This allows us to cache the SLL\r\n * ATN simulation whereas, if we had evaluated predicates on-the-fly during\r\n * closure, the DFA state configuration sets would be different and we couldn't\r\n * build up a suitable DFA.\r\n *\r\n * When building a DFA accept state during ATN simulation, we evaluate any\r\n * predicates and return the sole semantically valid alternative. If there is\r\n * more than 1 alternative, we report an ambiguity. If there are 0 alternatives,\r\n * we throw an exception. Alternatives without predicates act like they have\r\n * true predicates. The simple way to think about it is to strip away all\r\n * alternatives with false predicates and choose the minimum alternative that\r\n * remains.\r\n *\r\n * When we start in the DFA and reach an accept state that's predicated, we test\r\n * those and return the minimum semantically viable alternative. If no\r\n * alternatives are viable, we throw an exception.\r\n *\r\n * During full LL ATN simulation, closure always evaluates predicates and\r\n * on-the-fly. This is crucial to reducing the configuration set size during\r\n * closure. It hits a landmine when parsing with the Java grammar, for example,\r\n * without this on-the-fly evaluation.\r\n *\r\n * **SHARING DFA**\r\n *\r\n * All instances of the same parser share the same decision DFAs through a\r\n * static field. Each instance gets its own ATN simulator but they share the\r\n * same {@link ATN#decisionToDFA} field. They also share a\r\n * {@link PredictionContextCache} object that makes sure that all\r\n * {@link PredictionContext} objects are shared among the DFA states. This makes\r\n * a big size difference.\r\n *\r\n * **THREAD SAFETY**\r\n *\r\n * The {@link ParserATNSimulator} locks on the {@link ATN#decisionToDFA} field when\r\n * it adds a new DFA object to that array. {@link #addDFAEdge}\r\n * locks on the DFA for the current decision when setting the\r\n * {@link DFAState#edges} field. {@link #addDFAState} locks on\r\n * the DFA for the current decision when looking up a DFA state to see if it\r\n * already exists. We must make sure that all requests to add DFA states that\r\n * are equivalent result in the same shared DFA object. This is because lots of\r\n * threads will be trying to update the DFA at once. The\r\n * {@link #addDFAState} method also locks inside the DFA lock\r\n * but this time on the shared context cache when it rebuilds the\r\n * configurations' {@link PredictionContext} objects using cached\r\n * subgraphs/nodes. No other locking occurs, even during DFA simulation. This is\r\n * safe as long as we can guarantee that all threads referencing\r\n * `s.edge[t]` get the same physical target {@link DFAState}, or\r\n * `undefined`. Once into the DFA, the DFA simulation does not reference the\r\n * {@link DFA#states} map. It follows the {@link DFAState#edges} field to new\r\n * targets. The DFA simulator will either find {@link DFAState#edges} to be\r\n * `undefined`, to be non-`undefined` and `dfa.edges[t]` undefined, or\r\n * `dfa.edges[t]` to be non-undefined. The\r\n * {@link #addDFAEdge} method could be racing to set the field\r\n * but in either case the DFA simulator works; if `undefined`, and requests ATN\r\n * simulation. It could also race trying to get `dfa.edges[t]`, but either\r\n * way it will work because it's not doing a test and set operation.\r\n *\r\n * **Starting with SLL then failing to combined SLL/LL (Two-Stage\r\n * Parsing)**\r\n *\r\n * Sam pointed out that if SLL does not give a syntax error, then there is no\r\n * point in doing full LL, which is slower. We only have to try LL if we get a\r\n * syntax error. For maximum speed, Sam starts the parser set to pure SLL\r\n * mode with the {@link BailErrorStrategy}:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * parser.interpreter.{@link #setPredictionMode setPredictionMode}`(`{@link PredictionMode#SLL}`)`;\r\n * parser.{@link Parser#setErrorHandler setErrorHandler}(new {@link BailErrorStrategy}());\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * If it does not get a syntax error, then we're done. If it does get a syntax\r\n * error, we need to retry with the combined SLL/LL strategy.\r\n *\r\n * The reason this works is as follows. If there are no SLL conflicts, then the\r\n * grammar is SLL (at least for that input set). If there is an SLL conflict,\r\n * the full LL analysis must yield a set of viable alternatives which is a\r\n * subset of the alternatives reported by SLL. If the LL set is a singleton,\r\n * then the grammar is LL but not SLL. If the LL set is the same size as the SLL\r\n * set, the decision is SLL. If the LL set has size &gt; 1, then that decision\r\n * is truly ambiguous on the current input. If the LL set is smaller, then the\r\n * SLL conflict resolution might choose an alternative that the full LL would\r\n * rule out as a possibility based upon better context information. If that's\r\n * the case, then the SLL parse will definitely get an error because the full LL\r\n * analysis says it's not viable. If SLL conflict resolution chooses an\r\n * alternative within the LL set, them both SLL and LL would choose the same\r\n * alternative because they both choose the minimum of multiple conflicting\r\n * alternatives.\r\n *\r\n * Let's say we have a set of SLL conflicting alternatives `{1, 2, 3}` and\r\n * a smaller LL set called *s*. If *s* is `{2, 3}`, then SLL\r\n * parsing will get an error because SLL will pursue alternative 1. If\r\n * *s* is `{1, 2}` or `{1, 3}` then both SLL and LL will\r\n * choose the same alternative because alternative one is the minimum of either\r\n * set. If *s* is `{2}` or `{3}` then SLL will get a syntax\r\n * error. If *s* is `{1}` then SLL will succeed.\r\n *\r\n * Of course, if the input is invalid, then we will get an error for sure in\r\n * both SLL and LL parsing. Erroneous input will therefore require 2 passes over\r\n * the input.\r\n */\r\nlet ParserATNSimulator = class ParserATNSimulator extends ATNSimulator_1.ATNSimulator {\r\n    constructor(atn, parser) {\r\n        super(atn);\r\n        this.predictionMode = PredictionMode_1.PredictionMode.LL;\r\n        this.force_global_context = false;\r\n        this.always_try_local_context = true;\r\n        /**\r\n         * Determines whether the DFA is used for full-context predictions.

This speed hit is because the\r\n *  {@link Lexer}'s internal code goes from a monomorphic to megamorphic\r\n *  dynamic dispatch to get characters from the input stream. Java's\r\n *  on-the-fly compiler (JIT) is unable to perform the same optimizations\r\n *  so stick with either the old or the new streams, if performance is\r\n *  a primary concern.

If you need unbuffered\r\n *  access, please note that it becomes challenging to create\r\n *  parse trees. The parse tree has to point to tokens which will either\r\n *  point into a stale location in an unbuffered stream or you have to copy\r\n *  the characters out of the buffer into the token.
